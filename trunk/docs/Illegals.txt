               --- Undocumented ("illegal") opcodes ---


Since release 0.87, ACME contains support for some of the undocumented
opcodes of the 6502 processor. Here they are:

      |                 addressing  mode                 |
Mnemo |   8    8,x   8,y    16   16,x  16,y  (8,x) (8),y |  performs:
------+--------------------------------------------------+-----------
 slo  |   07    17    --    0f    1f    1b    03    13   |  asl + ora
 rla  |   27    37    --    2f    3f    3b    23    33   |  rol + and
 sre  |   47    57    --    4f    5f    5b    43    53   |  lsr + eor
 rra  |   67    77    --    6f    7f    7b    63    73   |  ror + adc
 sax  |   87    --    97    8f    --    --    83    --   |  stx + sta
 lax  |   a7    --    b7    af    --    bf    a3    b3   |  ldx + lda
 dcp  |   c7    d7    --    cf    df    db    c3    d3   |  dec + cmp
 isc  |   e7    f7    --    ef    ff    fb    e3    f3   |  inc + sbc

In release 0.89, more were added; and in 0.94.8, another one (lxa):

      |           addressing mode           |
Mnemo | implied #8    8    8,x    16   16,x |  performs:
------+-------------------------------------+------------------------
 anc  |   --    0b*   --    --    --    --  |  A = A & arg, then C=N
 asr  |   --    4b    --    --    --    --  |  A = A & arg, then lsr
 arr  |   --    6b    --    --    --    --  |  A = A & arg, then ror
 sbx  |   --    cb    --    --    --    --  |  X = (A & X) - arg
 dop  |   80**  80    04    14    --    --  |  skips next byte
 top  |   0c**  --    --    --    0c    1c  |  skips next two bytes
 jam  |   02    --    --    --    --    --  |  crash (wait for reset)
 lxa  |   --    ab*** --    --    --    --  |  A/X = (A | ??) & arg

Example:
		!cpu 6510	; activate additional mnemonics...
		lax (some_zp_label,x)	; ...and use them. No, this
		dcp (other_zp_label),y	; example does not make sense.

*) Up until ACME version 0.95.1, anc#8 generated opcode 0x2b. Since
ACME version 0.95.2, anc#8 generates opcode 0x0b. Both opcodes work
the same way.

**) Note that "dop" and "top" can be used with implied addressing, but
the generated opcodes are those for immediate and 16-bit absolute
addressing, respectively. Using dop/top with x-indexed addressing
might have its uses when timing is critical (crossing a page border
adds a penalty cycle).

***) This opcode is said to first perform an ORA with an arbitrary(!)
value, then do an AND with the given argument, then do a TAX.
This means it is unstable and therefore useless - unless the given
argument is zero, in which case it reliably clears both A and X.

There is no guarantee that these opcodes actually work on a given 6502
(or 6510, or 8500, or 8502) CPU. But as far as I know, nobody ever
found an unmodified C64/C128 where these illegals didn't work. That's
why I used "6510" as the CPU keyword instead of "6502illegal" or
something like that.

These illegals will definitely *not* work on 65c02 and 65816 CPUs. But
I really should not have to tell you that ;)

Because there are no official mnemonics for these opcodes, different
people use different names for them. I hope my choices are not too
exotic for your taste.

Just for the sake of completeness: Here are all the remaining opcodes
(the ones ACME won't generate):

Concerning opcodes 8b, 93, 9b, 9c, 9e, 9f, bb:

These opcodes are said to be unstable. For more information about what
they do, see these documents:
  John West, Marko Mäkelä. '64doc' file, 1994/06/03.
  Extra Instructions Of The 65XX Series CPU, Adam Vardy, 27 Sept. 1996
  6502 Undocumented Opcodes, by Freddy Offenga, 5/17/1997
  AAY64 (All About Your 64)

I did not see much point in assigning mnemonics for these opcodes. The
reference documents above call them:
  8b: ane, xaa
  93: sha, axa, ahx
  9b: shs, tas, xas
  9c: shy, say, sya
  9e: shx, xas, sxa
  9f: sha, axa, ahx
  bb: las, lar, lae
